Portfolio Projects

# [Project 1: SQL Exploratory Analysis and Tableau Dashboard of Covid-19](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/SQL-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Tableau-Dashboard-of-Covid-19)

Conducted exploratory analysis of Covid-19 data in SQL. Utilized different skillsets of SQL such as: Joins, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. Afterwards, I manually uploaded data into Excel and created a dashboard in Tableau.

## Tools / Languages Used:
* SQL
* Excel
* Tableau
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2018

# [Project 2: Key Indicators of Heart Disease Data Analysis](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Key-Indicators-of-Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis)

Utilized Python to conduct data analysis on dataset that contain key indicators of heart disease. Used statistical analysis such as a permutation test to understand correlation between a column and heart disease. Conducted further analysis by creating pivot tables and visualizations such as horizontal bar charts and scatter plots. Afterwards, created a PowerPoint to discuss my findings and provide possible heart disease prevention tactics

## Tools / Languages Used:
* Python 
  * Libraries: Datascience package, Numpy, Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
* Microsoft Powerpoint

# [Project 3: Covid-19 Database Design and PL/SQL Procedures](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Covid-19-Database-Design-and-PL-SQL-Procedures)

Designed a relational database where I created multiple tables linking them with primary-foreign key relationships. Afterwards, I created PL/SQL procedures to insert my own made up personal data with exception handling along with automating the process of querying data based on repetitive questions.

## Tools / Languages Used:
* SQL
* PL/SQL
* SQL Developer
* Oracle Database

# [Project 4: Crypto Website API Pull Automation](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Crypto-Website-API-Pull-Automation)

This project was created for my future self when I plan on getting into cryptocurrency. I wanted to create a Python script that appended the data of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. This data would then be appended into a CSV file rather than a pandas dataframe because I wanted the data to be an accumulation of multiple days and to avoid any issues if there was a crash. The data would then be read into Jupyter Notebooks where I can reformat the data for future analysis. I also Utilized CoinMarketCap's API in order to acquire the data. 

Note: I plan on running this script for the next few weeks to build up as much data as I can

## Tools / Languages Used
* Python
  * Libraries: pandas, seaborn, os, time, json, requests.exceptions, and requests
* Jupyter Notebooks

Tasked with helping a fictional bike-share company increase user membership. Created a business task and conducted various data analysis steps to uncover trends and findings. 

## Tools / Languages Used:
* R for:
  * Data Cleaning
  * Data Wrangling
  * Aggregation
  * Visualization
* RStudio
* Tableau
* Microsoft PowerPoint
