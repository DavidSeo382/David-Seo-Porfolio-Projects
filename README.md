Portfolio Projects

# [Project 1: SQL Exploratory Analysis and Tableau Dashboard of Covid-19](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/SQL-Exploratory-Analysis-and-Tableau-Dashboard-of-Covid-19)

Conducted exploratory analysis of Covid-19 data in SQL. Utilized different skillsets of SQL such as: Joins, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. Afterwards, I manually uploaded data into Excel and created a dashboard in Tableau.

## Tools / Languages Used:
* SQL
* Excel
* Tableau
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2018

# [Project 2: NFL Hall of Fame Web Scraper and Analysis](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/NFL-HOF-Webscraper-and-Analysis)

First created a webscraper using the BeautifulSoup library from Python to scrape a website that contained stats of every player in the NFL Hall of Fame. Afterwards, I cleaned the data and then used the os library to create a csv file. From here, I then analyzed the data by creating bar graphs and finding averages to see what qualifies someone to enter the Hall of Fame based on their stats and position.

## Tools / Languages Used:
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python
  * Libraries: BeautifulSoup, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express, os, urlopen

# [Project 3: Key Indicators of Heart Disease Data Analysis](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Key-Indicators-of-Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis)

Utilized Python to conduct data analysis on dataset that contain key indicators of heart disease. Used statistical analysis such as a permutation test to understand correlation between a column and heart disease. Conducted further analysis by creating pivot tables and visualizations such as horizontal bar charts and scatter plots. Afterwards, created a PowerPoint to discuss my findings and provide possible heart disease prevention tactics

## Tools / Languages Used:
* Python 
  * Libraries: Datascience package, Numpy, Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
* Microsoft Powerpoint

# [Project 4: Covid-19 Database Design and PL/SQL Procedures](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Covid-19-Database-Design-and-PL-SQL-Procedures)

Designed a relational database where I created multiple tables linking them with primary-foreign key relationships. Afterwards, I inserted my own made up personal data then created PL/SQL procedures with exception handling to automate the process of querying data based on repetitive questions.

## Tools / Languages Used:
* SQL
* PL/SQL
* SQL Developer
* Oracle Database

# [Project 5: Crypto Website API Pull Automation](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Crypto-Website-API-Pull-Automation)

Created a Python script that appended the data of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. This data would then be appended into a CSV file rather than a pandas dataframe because I wanted the data to be an accumulation of multiple days and to avoid any issues if there was a crash. The data would then be read into Jupyter Notebooks where I can reformat the data for future analysis. I also Utilized CoinMarketCap's API in order to acquire the data. 

## Tools / Languages Used
* Python
  * Libraries: pandas, seaborn, os, time, json, requests.exceptions, and requests
* Jupyter Notebooks

# [Project 6: Data Cleaning and Dashboard of Bike Sales in Excel](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Excel-Bike-Sales)

Took a dataset about Bike sales into Excel and created an interactive dashboard. Process involved first cleaning the data. This step consisted of removing duplicates, using filters to check for correct unique elements, changing cell formats, and using the find & replace feature to change cells to make it more cohesive for the analysis stage. For example, for one of the columns that contained the ages of individuals, I used the find & replace feature to create three seperate groups for ages rather than having ages ranging from 25 to 89. Afterwards, I created three Pivot Tables along with a bar chart and two line graphs. Then I created an interactive dashboard that used slicers for the three graphs to give the option of filtering them by their marital status, education, or region.

## Tools / Languages Used:
* Excel 
 * Pivot Tables, Find & Replace, Filters, Graphs, Slicers, Remove Duplicates

# [Project 7: Data Analysis on a Bike-Sharing Company](https://github.com/DavidSeo382/Data-Analysis-on-a-Bike-Sharing-Company)

Tasked with helping a fictional bike-share company increase user membership. Created a business task and conducted various data analysis steps to uncover trends and findings. 

## Tools / Languages Used:
* R for:
  * Data Cleaning
  * Data Wrangling
  * Aggregation
  * Visualization
* RStudio
* Tableau
* Microsoft PowerPoint
