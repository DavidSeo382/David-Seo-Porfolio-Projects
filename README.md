## Description:
Background Information: Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. They offer more than 5,800 bicycles at 600 docking stations to provide transportation to various users based on their pricing plans. These plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Riders who purchase single and full-day passes are considered casual riders while annual memberships are considered Cyclistic members. 

The business task is what could motivate casual riders to change to an annual subscription?
